# BARBIE

An home automation app that utilises speech recognition and NLP to understand and recognise the words and accordingly responds to the user talking or chatting. <br />
The AI bot after understanding the command by the user replies to the user in speech form and via text just like Smart Assisstants as Alexa or Siri.<br />
The bot using NLP detects specific words such as Home,Room,Door,Lights, and other electrical appliances reference and then triggers a request to the server which operates the Raspberry Pi to perform different IOT functions such turning the bulbs on or off etc.<br />
This is an IOT project and was created in the ISGW Hackathon 2017.<br />
Below are some screenshots of the app.<br />
